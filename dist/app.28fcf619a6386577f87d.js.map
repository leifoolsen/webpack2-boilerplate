For touch or mouse, this\n        occurs at the point of contact. A touch ripple indicates where and when\n        a touch occurs and acknowledges that the touch input was received.\n        Transitions, or actions triggered by input events, should visually\n        connect to input events. Ripple reactions near the epicenter occur\n        sooner than reactions further away.\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <br/>\n\n    <div class={app.democontainer} style={{marginBottom: '2px'}}>\n      <div class={app.rippledemo}>\n        <h5>&lt;button&gt; element with ripple</h5>\n        <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>\n          <button class={button['Button-primary']} type=\"button\">\n            Primary\n            <Ripple/>\n          </button>\n          <button class={classnames(button['Button-primary'], button['Button--stroked'])} type=\"button\">\n            Primary\n            <Ripple/>\n          </button>\n          <button class={classnames(button['Button-primary'], button['Button--filled'])} type=\"button\">\n            Primary\n            <Ripple/>\n          </button>\n        </div>\n        <pre><small>{codeSampleButtonElement}</small></pre>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class={app.rippledemo}>\n        <h5>&lt;Button&gt; component with ripple</h5>\n        <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>\n          <Button className={button['Button-secondary']} ripple>\n            Secondary\n          </Button>\n          <Button className={button['Button-secondary']} stroked ripple>\n            Secondary\n          </Button>\n          <Button className={button['Button-secondary']} filled raised ripple>\n            Secondary\n          </Button>\n        </div>\n        <pre><small>{codeSampleButtonComponent}</small></pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class={app.rippledemo}>\n        <h5>&lt;IconButton&gt; component with ripple</h5>\n        <IconButton className={button['Button-success']} label=\"Icon button with ripple\" size=\"xl\" filled raised ripple>\n          <i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"material-icons\">check</i>\n        </IconButton>\n        <pre><small>{codeSampleIconButtonComponent}</small></pre>\n      </div>\n      <div class={app.rippledemo}>\n        <h5>&lt;div&gt; element with ripple</h5>\n        <br/>\n        <div class={app.democontainer}>\n          <div class={classnames(app.colordemo, color.textColorPrimary)} style={{position: 'relative'}}>\n            <p class={app.ingress}><b>Touche moi</b></p>\n            <Ripple/>\n          </div>\n          <div class={classnames(app.colordemo, color.primary)} style={{position: 'relative'}}>\n            <p class={app.ingress}><b>Touch me</b></p>\n            <Ripple/>\n          </div>\n          <div class={app.colordemo} style={{position: 'relative', backgroundColor: '#000000', color: '#ffffff'}}>\n            <p class={app.ingress}><b>Berør meg</b></p>\n            <Ripple/>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <pre><small>{codeSampleDivElement}</small></pre>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Ripple in still water<br/>\n        When there is no pebble tossed<br/>\n        Nor wind to blow</p>\n      <p><cite>Ripple, Grateful Dead</cite></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </div>\n;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./app/views/Ripples.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
